A kernel is the fundamental core of a computer's operating system (OS), acting as a bridge between hardware and software to manage system resources like CPU, memory, and devices. It handles crucial tasks such as process scheduling, memory management, and input/output (I/O) requests, ensuring all components work together efficiently and securely.

Simple Definition of Firmware:

Firmware is a type of software that is permanently stored in a device's memory and provides low-level control for the device's hardware. It tells the device how to operate and interacts directly with the hardware, allowing it to perform its basic functions. Unlike regular software, firmware is "built-in" and typically doesn't get updated often (although it can be updated in some cases).

For example:

In a microwave, firmware controls the timer, the buttons, and the display.

In a smartphone, firmware controls the basic functions like turning the screen on/off or controlling the camera hardware.

Complex Definition of Firmware:

Firmware refers to specialized software that is embedded within hardware devices to control and manage their functions. It is stored in non-volatile memory (such as ROM, flash memory, or EEPROM) and provides the foundational instructions for hardware operation, often at a low level. It can operate directly with the device's hardware (e.g., CPU, sensors, display) and enables higher-level software to interact with the hardware effectively.

Firmware can range from simple control routines in embedded systems (e.g., microcontrollers) to more sophisticated systems like BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) in personal computers, which manage hardware initialization during the boot process.

Firmware is typically designed to be optimized for the specific hardware it runs on, and its updates, when they occur, often fix bugs or improve performance without altering the overall functionality of the device. In some cases, firmware can also facilitate device-specific security features and hardware-level encryption.

Examples:

Embedded Systems: Microcontrollers and programmable logic devices (PLDs) running control loops, sensor data processing, or even embedded operating systems (RTOS).

Consumer Electronics: Embedded firmware in digital cameras, routers, smart TVs, or printers.

Computers: The BIOS/UEFI is a form of firmware responsible for the initial hardware checks during boot-up, initialization of essential peripherals, and passing control to the operating system.

Key Characteristics of Firmware:

Non-Volatile: It stays in memory even when the device is powered off.

Low-Level: It directly interfaces with hardware and is often written in low-level programming languages like assembly.

Specialized: It’s tailored for the specific hardware it controls.

Updates: Though firmware is generally stable, it can be updated to fix bugs or add features.

To summarize:

Simple terms: Firmware is like the "brain" of your device that tells it what to do with its hardware, and it’s built right into the device.

Complex terms: Firmware is low-level software that directly interacts with and controls a device's hardware, enabling basic operations and potentially interacting with higher-level software. It is often stored in non-volatile memory and optimized for specific devices.

so is firmware kernel?
ChatGPT said:

Great question — and no, firmware is not the same as the kernel, though they are both essential parts of a computer or embedded system.

Let's break it down clearly:

✅ Firmware vs Kernel — Key Differences
Feature	Firmware	Kernel
What it is	Low-level software embedded in hardware	Core part of the operating system
Where it runs	On the hardware itself, often before the OS loads	In system memory, after bootloader runs it
Purpose	Initializes hardware, enables basic control	Manages system resources (CPU, memory, devices)
When it runs	Very early in the boot process	After firmware and bootloader, as part of the OS
Example	BIOS/UEFI, microcontroller firmware in a toaster	Linux kernel, Windows NT kernel
Updatability	Rarely updated, specific to hardware	Frequently updated as part of OS upgrades
🧠 How They Work Together (Boot Sequence Example)

Firmware (e.g., BIOS/UEFI) starts first.

Initializes the CPU, memory, and hardware.

Checks devices (POST).

Finds the boot device and loads the bootloader.

Bootloader (e.g., GRUB, U-Boot) is loaded next.

Its job is to find and load the kernel.

Kernel (e.g., Linux, Windows kernel) is then loaded by the bootloader.

Takes over full control of the system.

Sets up drivers, memory management, process scheduling, etc.

Launches the user space (the rest of the OS).

🛠️ Real-World Analogy

Think of a computer like a car:

Firmware = the ignition system — it wakes everything up and gets things ready.

Kernel = the engine control system — it runs the car once it’s started, managing fuel, speed, brakes, etc




The serveice is a program that runs as a background process  
File System is the method for storing and organizing the files in the system


Xwindow system  provides the toolkit and standard protocals for building guis on nearly all linux sstems

Desktop environment is the GUI on top of the operating system 
Command line is the interface for typing commands on top of the OS

Shell is the commandline interpreter that interpretes the commandlineinput and instructs the system to perform any neccesary tasks and commands eg. bash, zsh, and tcsh


LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS
Network and services protocalas known as daemons long runing background processes httpd ect ends with d 

LINUX BASICS AND SYSTEM STARTUP
Linux boot process is the procedure for starting the system from when the user switches on to the point where the computer is operational

BIOS: The first step (Basic Input output system)
initializes the screen and keyboard and tests the main memory BIOS is stored on the ROM chip in the motehrboard Then after the boot process is controlled by teh OS 

Once POST is done the boot control is passed from the BIOS to the bootloader and is eithere sored in the ootsector in the MBR or  in UEFI(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)

Both UEFI and BIOS are types of firmware—software that’s built into your computer’s hardware to help it start up and manage basic functions before the operating system loads



The bootloader can give ou the otions to like GRUB, 
For the system residing in MBR the boorloader is stored in the first sector of the harddisk (aLSO KNOWN AS the maste boot record)
=> the sixe of MBR is 512Bytes


For UFI/UEFI it reads it uefi boot manager to determine which uefi appplication is to be launhed  and from where, The firmware then lauches UEFI application like RUB as definied by the bootentry in the frimware boot manager and then after choosing the os the bootloader load the kernel o the operating system into RAM and passes control to it.

KErnels are always compressed so the first josb is alwas to uncompress itself and after this it will notoalize the device hardware and drivers built in the systems' kernel


INITIAL RAM DISK

The init ram/fs file image contais programs and binariy files that perform all actions needed to mount the proper file syetem like provinding the proper kernelfunctionalitiesn for the need file syetem and devicae drivers for mass storeage controllers  with a facility called UDEV for user device whic is reposible for figuring out which devices are present locating the device drivers they need to operate properly and loading them, 

After the root file system has been found   its checked for errors then mounted Thenafter it istructs the OS the file sytems is ready fo use and it associates it with that particular poitn in the hierrachy file system the mount point

If this is succesiful the Init ram fs is cleared from rAM fs and the init program from the root system is executed 

INIT handles the mounting and pivoting to the final real root system, if special harware drives are needed bfore the mass storage can be acessed they must be in the init ram fs image 


TEXT_LOGIN MODE
In the end of the boot process init start a number of text mode prompts these enable you to type your username followe by ur pswrd and to eventually get the command shell 

HOWEVER 
if u are running a GUI several you wont see these comand at first

usually the commandshell is bash The shell prints command shell indicating its ready to receive commands, when a command is typed its executes and the other command is printed/displayed beau:)

THE INUX KERNEL
The bootloader load the INITram and kernel so that it can be used by the kernel, when loaded in ram it initializes and configures the computer's memory it also configures all the harware attached to the system, including processors, IO subsysems, storage devices and more also loads the userspace applocations 


/sbin/init and services
after the kernel is done with all that the te kernel run that folder and this beocmes te initial/parent process and then start othe procvesses to get the system running, In the exeptions of the kernel processes most processes start from the /sbin /init

apart form starting the system it keep  the system running and its important fot shutting the system cleanly
=> manages the background processes and the login logut services as needed and does the same for the backeground processes
this ssequenial run level method which is originally by the unix V, is outdated though its is emulated for compatibility purposes and other methods are currently used

New methods of sytemd which have become dominant

systemd
startup faster than those with init methods, this is because it replaces the serialiced methods with parallel methods which permits multiple methods to be initiated simulatineously

Note: now /sbin/init now points to /lib/systemd/systemd


systemctl usage
=> starting, stopping and restarting aservice (using httpd, Apache webserver as an esample) on a concurrrenly runnig system
$ sudo start|stop|restart httpd.service

Enabling or disabling a system service from string up at the system boot
$ sudo systemctl andble|disable httpd.service



LINUX FILE SYSTEM BASICS
File systems suppoterd by Linux include:
=> COnvectionsl file systems ext2,3 XFS, BTRFS JFS, NTFS, vfat etc
=>flash storage system
=> Database file system
=> special file system



PARTITIONS AND FILE SYSTEMS
A partitions is a physically contiguous section of the disk or what appears to be so in advanced dsetups 

A file system is method od storing or finding files on a harddisk file systems can span more than one partition if one uses symbolic links




CMPRSON BTN FILE SYSTEMS
/dev/sda1 partition
Base folder / and in windows c:\

The file system HIERRACHY (FHS) standard
Linux stores their important files in a standard layout called  that name above 

/bin/ - Esssential user command binaries
/boot/- static files of the bootloader
/dev/- devic files
/etc/- Host-speciefic system configurationrequired directories OPT, XIML, 
/home/- user home directories
/lib/- essential sared libraries and kernel modules
/media/- mount point for rmovable media
/mnt/- mount point for a temporary mounted file system
/opt/- add-on application softaware packages
/sbin/- systm binaries
/srv/- data for services provided in this system 
/tmp/- temporary files
/usr/- multi user utulities and applications
/var/-variable files 
/proc/- virtual file system documenting the kernel and process status as text files 
/root/- home directory for the root user

CHAPTER 04: Graphical interface:
The x-windows system is loaded as one of the final process in the boot process often called x and the   the desktop manager keeps track of the displays being provided and loads the x server so called because it provides the graphical services to applications. sometimes called the x client, due to security concerns it is slowly replaced by wayland and it looks just like x but with different impelementation under the hood.


Reference: impelementation of the wayland server

Desktop environment consists of: 
=> Session manager -starts and maintains the session of the graphical component

=> Window manager - controls the placement and position of the window title bars and controls
=> Set of utilities all these provide a seamless desktop environment

Gnomeis the popular desktop environment and its bundled as the default environment for most linux distributions

another de and important in the history of linux is kde


gnome-tweaks
you can pull this by hittind ctrl f2 and it is mostly instaled by default 

Hidden files are configuration files that are hidden by default

the gdm user manager prsents the user with the login screen


Logging out kill all the processes in your current session and returns to the display manager login screen

Suspending puts the computer in a sleep mode
Every user created will have the home directory

Nautllus gives you three options to view files
Nautilus file manager was developed by Eazel, a now-defunct company:

Founded in 1999 by former Apple engineers.

Their vision was to make Linux more user-friendly, starting with the GNOME file manager.

Eazel named the project Nautilus — likely blending both the biological and literary meanings


System configuratiosn from the GUI
=> Use system settings panel
=> Use network manager
=> Install and update software

By defal linux uses coordinated universal time and that relies on the system time zones to get the proper time
UTC vs GMT – Super TL;DR

UTC = modern, precise time standard (used globally)

GMT = older, UK-based time zone

Both = same time, but UTC is more accurate and preferred today ✅

Network time protocal
Important and relible ip for ssetting time by consulting established servers, Lnux distributions always comes with a working NTP setup 


Network configuration 
All linux distros haave nc files

For debian systems dpkg is the underlying package manager for the system can istall remove and build packages
Apt-advanced package tool
apt respositiories are compatible, developers ship with mulriple repostories to support multiple distributions

Rpt= redhat package tool 
yast= is another application management tool



COMMON LINUX APPLICATIONS:
yapping nothing much

COMMAND LINE OPERATIONS:
advantages:
no GUI overhead is incurred
virtually any task can be accomplished at the command line argument
You can impelement scripts for often used (or easy to forget) tasks and a series of procedures
You can signi in in any remote machines over the internet
You can initiate graphical applications through cml  instead of hunting through menus
While graphical tools may vary through sidtributions the commandline dont

Utility software is a program or tool that performs specific tasks to enhance productivity, efficiency, functionality, or maintenance of a computer system.





You can hit alt f2 and type in gnome-terminal or konsole
cat => used to type in a file
head => show in the first few lines of a file
tail=> use to show last few lines of a file
man=> used to view documentation


THE COMMND LINE

Important parts of a command
command -options arguments
ls      -a       /home/angela 

the options often start with either a single or double dashes

sudo
provides the user with administrative privilleges when reqired
setting up and running sudo in your system
type "su" and enter password 
create a config file on etc/sudoers.d/ with the same name as your username
eg. echo "student ALL = (ALL)" > etc/sudoers.d/student

some distributions will complain if you dont change permissions on the fileby doing chmod 440 etc/sudoers.d/student
